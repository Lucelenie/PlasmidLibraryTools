# PlasmidLibraryTools

Here we have the Chodera Lab Plasmid Library. It includes a csv, which is a download of the google spreadsheet in 'upkeep' and some tools to help analyze sequencing data.

`plasmid_sequences` - contains sequences for full plasmids
`sequencing data by clone` - contains sequencing results by clone ID

This is the plasmid library:
